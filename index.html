		<h2 class="title">What's going on in my head</h2>
		<p class="random">So let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a musician at heart and I love to spend my time tinkering away on different projects. I recently started getting back into web development after a few years. I'm trying to build a portfolio and utilize my knowledge of graphic design to take my programming to the next level.</p>
			<h2 class="title">Where i'm at now</h2>
			<p>I have been getting back in the groove of developing. As of now, I have the understanding of HTML5 and CSS5. I plan on furthering my knowledege of Javascripting and picking up other useful languages as i go. Follow me on social media and my music projects down below.</p>
